# Goofy-H-Social-Solutions
Horiseon Solution homework 1
The purpose of this project was to make the website more accessible by refactoring the code. This was achieved by utilizing HTML 5 semantics. The CSS file was updated to match with a few comments added for future reference.  The elements were lined up to follow a sequential order. A descriptive title was added to aid in web searches and alternate attributes were used to aid in accessibility. A screen shot was also added to show that original page was unaltered and the page functionality was improved.

Contributions:  I would like to thank my tutor, Joseph Young for his guidance especially for the Git upload walk-throughs. The OSU bootcamp study group, "the underdogs".
The changes were made by myself, Ronda Heimberger.
